This is the first all-in-one computer I have used as well as the first Dell brand desktop computer I have used in recent years. I am always a little concerned when computers are shipped, but this computer arrived in a very large outer Amazon packed full of brown heavy-duty paper for protection. The enclosed Dell box was secure with no damage, and everything inside was tightly packed as well. While not overtly heavy, the outer box was a little difficult to handle with just one person. Nonetheless, I was able to get everything out of the box and setup in my work-space in just a few minutes.
Given the all-in-one nature of this unit, it is extremely easy and convenient to setup and takes up a relatively compact amount of desktop space. The 23.8 inch screen is very nice and clear without being overwhelming for a computer this size. Features that were new to me were the built in wireless connection for internet access as well as the built in speakers and webcam. Essentially, this PC combines many of my favorite laptop features and components with the functionality and productivity of a desktop computer. Sound quality from the speakers is surprisingly clear, and I was able to get a very strong Wi-Fi single despite being two rooms away from the model in my house.
While there are certainly more advanced and powerful computers on the market, this PC is respectable in terms of functionality and ability. It features a 500GB hard drive and Intel 2.3 GHz Core i3 6100U processor. It is definitely not a gaming computer or one for very intensive multimedia projects, but it never claims to be. This computer is perfect for everyday internet browsing, playing games, watching movies and TV shows, and using office suite software. While it is essentially considered a home and family PC, I could see this working in a small office environment as well, particularly if you have limited space. The unit itself is surprisingly not that heavy, so it does give you some flexibility as well since you do not have to deal with a separate tower and all the accompanying cords.
My entire family has been very pleased with this computer, and I am definitely going to consider Dell more seriously in the future. Overall, if you are looking for an everyday use PC with decent performance and flexibility in terms of size and weight, this is definitely a unit I would recommend.

I really like that this is an all in one computer.
It's nice that it's compact so it doesn't take up so much of my desk.
desktop#aesthetics#size 2 1
The screen is a nice size.
screen#aesthetics#size 2 1
The performance however leaves something to be desired.
I use this computer approximately 8 hours a day 5 days a week and I have noticed that it definitely has slowed down a lot since I first started using it.
I don't save a lot directly to the computer because I use an external hard drive so I'm not sure exactly why it's starting to lag.
Start up has gotten especially slow.
When I first started using it it would start up very quickly.
Now it take several minutes.
The most annoying thing about this computer is that at least twice a day, every day it will just freeze out of nowhere and I have to restart it.
This is not only annoying and wastes my time but have lost work as a result.
I have gotten in the habit of constantly saving whatever I"m working on but I always end up losing something due to it just freezing out of nowhere.
I definitely would not purchase this again if I had a choice.

This is my honest review of Dell i3265 Inspiron all in one desktop computer.
I have used this desktop primarily for the kids computer programs like typing, math, reading, science, etc.
All the programs I've uploaded and downloaded work well without errors.
I personally did not have any issues with speed and it does process quickly.
desktop#performance#speed 2 1
I do not use this for "gaming" so for the people who said it was slow, maybe it has too many programs running?
desktop#performance#heavy 0 1
I deleted most of the apps or things that it comes with standard and installed Microsoft 10 and a few educational software programs and it works just as fast as the first day.
Overall, I've been quite happy with the performance of this Dell for my family needs of basic Web browsing and kids educational programs.
The style is clean and modern , its the nicest desktop we've ever owned.

Dell has a knack for taking a popular product from another company and applying a ham-fisted design to make a similar product. In this case, Dell seems to want to pay tribute to the first iMac with an LCD. In terms of design, they almost pull it off. Had they included wireless peripherals, they would have really had something. Sadly, they paired this computer with the cheapest wired keyboard and mouse pair they could find.
Not a difficult problem to fix, but it really would have improved the out of box experience.
The placement of the USB ports, ethernet jack, headphone jack, and SD card reader is reasonably smart.
While I appreciate that they thought to include HDMI out, the port placement on the back doesn't make that much sense to me. Because Dell thought to include an optical drive (presumably for watching DVD's), I think it would have made a little more sense for an HDMI input in order for this to serve double duty as a TV.

The display is "acceptable", given the price.
screen#quality#overall 1 1
Rendering dark colors quickly drops off into a black abyss, reminiscent of LCD panels from almost a decade ago. Most lower-end 21" displays you'd buy in a store today would probably kick this computer's butt in terms of blacks and shadows.

As for the computer itself, Dell showed a little restraint in loading it up with bloatware.
They push McAfee pretty hard, but otherwise, it isn't terrible.
I have to say, though, that may be the brightest spot.
Performance is really, really disappointing out of the box.
From powering on to updating everything, it took nearly two hours before this was good to go.
As a reference point, my Surface Pro 4 clocked in at about 45 minutes (yes, that includes the Creator update).
Is it fair to compare this to a last-generation Core i7 with 16 gigs and a PCIe SSD? No.
But if you're used to any Core i5 or i7 from any generation, this computer is going to seem really pokey.
I didn't bother to pinpoint whether or not it was the slow (but commendably large) hard drive, or strange RAM configuration.
I had extra RAM and an SSD lying around.
I had a screwdriver.
The rest is history.
If you max this out with 16GB RAM and a decent SSD (any 2.5" SATA drive should work), things improve considerably.
But if you don't have those parts just lying around, it also pushes up the price of this computer considerably.
At the time of this writing, it doesn't push you into iMac territory, but it could definitely get you a refurbished ASUS AIO with a Core i5 and touchscreen, or an Acer AIO with a Core i5 and GeForce 940M graphics.
It isn't a "So slow I'm going to throw it out a window" kind of thing, but this quickly went from "Maybe this'll be a good upgrade for my kid's Chromebook" to "I think I can make space for it in the kitchen, and use it for looking up recipes / watching streaming video while cooking.
So who is this computer for? Probably someone who doesn't use a computer for much more than media consumption.
Maybe "baby's first computer" or "Grandma's eBay terminal" kind of uses.
For a family computer, or "My kid is off to college" computer, I really don't think this is going to cut it.

I have to start this review with the disclaimer that, while I use a computer every day (who doesn't, right?) and have been for at least the last 15 years or so, I don't know much about how they run or what makes one better than another.

I am a Vine Voice reviewer and I chose to accept and review this Dell desktop computer, because the desktop machine my family had been using before was running on a wildly outdated operating system.

Overall, we're content with this machine, although frustrated with how slow it runs.
Per my disclaimer, I don't know what it is about the machine that makes it run more slowly than, say, my work computer, but it just does.
Perhaps the relatively inexpensive list price is a clue to that.
As far as size and look, it's fine.

This is a decent enough home desktop for personal/family use.
No, it won't be able to play many games, but it's a basic machine for web surfing/Office and other tasks.
The form factor is nice, and it was easy to set up and get going.
The out of the box experience is basic - Windows 10 will take its time configuring itself and get you up and ready.
The keyboard and mouse are included and nothing special - but they're the solid Dell base peripherals.
Overall the computer was responsible and not too sluggish.
There's both wireless and a wired connection, so you're able to place this wherever suits you - and was easy to get set up.
The display is pretty good - it's not totally amazing but after a few hours of watching movies and web browsing, I didn't feel any eye strain.
As for the ports: We've got two USB 2.0 ports and two USB 3.0 ports that are side mounted.
It seems a bit odd to not have a USB 3.0 port on the rear - because presumably it'd be more elegant if you had an external drive that you'd keep permanently attached and not have to deal with slower speeds of USB 2.0.
There is a HDMI out, a DVD drive (download VLC to watch movies to avoid paying for the DVD playback codec) and a 4 in 1 card reader, so you can connect SD cards from your digital camera.
As for the processor: it's basic and light use. Benchmarks put this as slower as an Intel Core i3 5005U but not by much.
I think the bottleneck is the slower hard drive.
The 6gb of RAM seems sufficient as long as you're not pushing intensive applications.
For those brave souls, it is possible to replace the internal hard drive with a SSD and do a clean install of Windows using the Windows 10 Media Creation tool, but it will require a decent amount of work to get right.
The computer is only upgradeable to 8gb of RAM.
I hate to say this - but this is a desktop that's made for people over 60 or those with extreme basic needs in a desktop computer.
The price is right (~$500) and my mom loves it for basic things.

It is powered by an AMD A6-7310 APU and thus is not a speed demon, but it works for surfing, email, word processing, photo viewing, etc.

This is a first desktop computer for our 11 year old son.

Warning: after updating windows when the machine is restarted, you may see a "Getting Windows Ready" screen for a **really** long time.

I began to suspect that something was wrong.

However, it eventually finished, starting up normally.

As Windows will initially download many updates, it's probably more reasonable to gauge the speed and responsiveness of the computer once the updates are finished installing.

You know how it is with these computers, over time you install more and more stuff, there are OS upgrades, and if you wait a year or two then the RAM is incredibly expensive because its nearly obsolescence.

Overall the pc is beautiful, awesome sound quality, awesome features, design is unique so far and well built.

Love the fact that it has I7 instead of I5.

The upgrade to I7 is really worth it.
Best PC I've ever bought.

I have yet to find no bad things about this PC.
No regrets:)

Everything works as it should.

The large screen allows two pages to be shown side by side which is nice.

The integrated beats audio allows me to get rid of all my peripheral speakers.

It is a marvelous 'computer' audio system, but not to be mistaken for a high end stereo system.

Fine for my needs on the computer.

I got this computer for my dorm at my base.

I was gonna cheap out and get a $200 computer but I saw this in the store and fell in love.

So I made the investment and brought it back to the dorm and not a day goes by where I don't love this thing.

The touch screen is on spot, the responsiveness is amazing, the color is beautiful, the screen size is perfect, and the audio is killer (basically a beats pill).

Oh plus it has an HDMI in slot to double as a TV monitor.

This is by far the fastest and best computer I have ever used or owned (and I have a $2000 iMac back home).

I highly suggest this, it is worth the price trust me.

I also love that the keyboard and mouse is wireless allowing me to control Netflix from my bed lol.

Also, I have to shut down and unplug anything in my dorm when unoccupied so I thought this would be a big hassle from previous experience with other computers.

That is not the case with this thing.

Shutdown is under 30 seconds from when I hit the button to when I can unplug it.

And from plug in back to the loading screen is easily under a minute.

I also love the adjustable kickstand allowing me to basically lay this out flat or stand straight up and everywhere in between.

This makes it so much easier for me.

I have nothing but good to say about this.

I'll try to attach some pictures.

The little hook you see coming out of the top left is a retractable hook to hang your headphones or earbuds.

Not sure I'll use it but pretty neat.

Also, I really love the black and red color scheme.

I hesitated and looked at less expensive computers, but decided that you do get what you pay for.

I bought a $400 computer and it kept freezing up and was super slow, I had to return in it was so slow, so paying and extra few hundred dollars was well worth it.

I expect this computer to meet my needs for years to come!
