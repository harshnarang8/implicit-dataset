					Any laptops with everything this has will cost between 650-750 dollars and they won't even have all that this laptop has to offer, first I'm an IT I work on computers daily so getting an Asus (top 3 consumer laptop brand) at this price with these specs is all you need to know to buy it.

					All in all from an IT's prospective this is the best dang laptop your going to find at this price and even above it, did I mention you can even add a second M.2 sata III ssd and it will using an Intel technology will see the HDD and the ssd as 1 drive and move all your most used content to the ssd for fast access and use the HDD for basic storage.

					My only single complaint about this computer doesn't bother me much but it will bother regular users of this laptop and that's the fact that you have to take off the entire bottom of the laptop to access the HDD, to add the M.2 sata III ssd, and to add ram, this includes taking off the two back rubber feet to access screws under them.
