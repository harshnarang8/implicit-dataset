I know most people cringe when thinking about Microsoft hardware.

There have been some massive failures over the years.

Remember around the time of the first iphone, the Windows Phones on AT&T?

What a mess.

Remember trying to update them?

The Surface line of tablets have actually been pretty good, but in the end most people either just want a really good tablet or a good laptop.

The surface laptops have filled a nice need which is a speedy laptop that is super slim and can act like a tablet as well.

I connected headphones expecting for the quality to be better.

But it was still bad.

That means it's not the speakers.

It has to be the sound card or drivers.

I tried updating the Realtek drivers since that is the brand, but the update didn't fix it.

I instead installed the default Windows drivers, and magically there were no more issues with sound.

Even though I had to play with the drivers to fix the sound, I still consider it to be a solid buy.

There is some bloatware that comes with it, but I deleted all of that.

The TN panel that comes with the laptop is absolutely horrible.
The color reproduction is acceptable at most, and its contrast is straight up garbage town.
Even when you look at the panel dead on, you can still see color shifting at corners of the screen.
You will not be using this laptop for any professional work; even media consumption is average at most.
The performance of the laptop, however, deserves praise.
The GTX 1050 inside do wonders when it comes to graphic demanding tasks like games.
GTA V can be ran smoothly on this at about 60 FPS on high settings.
If your budget allows, I would take a look at the Dell XPS 15, for a couple hundred more dollars, it gives you a better screen and a better build quality.

After a month of using this laptop for normal college uses, the keys get stuck which creates the backlight look poor.
The keys are still pressable, just the backlight looks horrible.
Battery life is okay, lasts about 4 to 5 hours for normal uses and some photo editing.
Gaming on this laptop isn't recommended unless you want to always be plugged in.
The battery life can range from 30 minutes to 1.5 hours before it states you need to charge.

In order to change the volume on the keyboard you need to press the fn button and then the f10 to f12 buttons, which are on the other side of the keyboard.

This means that even a person with as large of hands as I has to struggle to reach it with on hand, which for me is inconvenient.

It would have been smart to switch the volume control with the screen control which is closer to the fn button.

Also, its annoying that the computer turns itself off whenever you close the computer, so if you are playing a game, make sure you save before you close the computer because otherwise you are losing your progress.

Battery life is pretty bad.

The keyboard lights up and looks great.

let me just start off by saying that i am a college student going to school to become an ESL elementary school teacher.

I dont use any fancy programs other than Microsoft office and browsing the web and saving files.

I bought the base model which came with the core i5 (7th gen) processor, 2.5 GHz processor with turbo boost to 3.1, a 256 GB SSD with 8 GB of DDR3 RAM.

the track pad could be better, i find that you will need to get used to it but over all it is a very nice size and has a sleek design with the no button clickers there.

it is like the mack books just not as big.
Over all the laptop does not sacrifice the ports, i feel like you get a good selection of ports such as 2 USB ports I believe a 2.0 and a 3.0, also a full size SD card reader, a headphone jack, a USB type c port, and micro HDMI port and of course they proprietary charging port for the charger.
I very much recommend this laptop for any one who wants a nice laptop that looks and feels premium just not at those premium prices and at a very good price, and is LIGHT WEIGHT because this thing is not a hassle to take with you anywhere.

I bought this laptop a couple weeks ago after my old macbook finally gave up the ghost, and overall I'm pretty pleased with it.
The fingerprint reader works well, the graphics are pretty decent, and overall it runs very well; I haven't had any trouble playing video games or running Photoshop.
It's very thin and light, which I really appreciate, and the battery is pretty good--I can go most of a day with lighter/normal usage, less than that if I'm playing games or running something heavy like Photoshop.
It doesn't have a CD drive, but i have an external one that hooks up fine.
I appreciate how there's one usb port on either side, which gets around the problem of when you have a flash drive or something that's just a little too big and makes it so you can't use the other port.
I do wish the SD card reader went in a little deeper, though; i was hoping to be able to just leave an sd card in the slot to save art files to, but the port is shallow enough that about half the card sticks out.
I have, however, had a few problems running Chrome.
Youtube videos tend to lag or get staticky/choppy if I'm doing too much in other tabs, and if your internet connection is finicky, then Chrome freezes constantly.
However, I suspect this might just be an intersection of Chrome and Windows 10, rather than a problem with the laptop itself, since my old mac never had that particular problem.
Overall, I would say this is a good laptop if you're somewhere that has a good internet connection.

Regarding some of the issues other reviewers have brought up:

1) the trackpad works okay for me; when I am home I use a usb mouse, but on the road the trackpad is fine - no worse than others i have had;

2) the screen seemed a little dim, but when I turned off the ambient light sensor (a tip from another reviewer) it brightened right up; use the fn-A key combination to do that;

3) speakers are adequate for listening to quiet music in a hotel room - i do that constantly; if you want better/louder/multimedia speakers you need a much heavier laptop; the tradeoff is acceptable to me.

The zen book does live up to expectations regarding noise, because there is very little to no sound from the fans even when being used to capacity.
The laptop hardly ever heats up and usually cool to the touch even after streaming for hours on end.
My main qualm with this laptop is it’s lack of CD drive and the trackpad sensing seems to be a bit off, especially when using the 3 and 4 finger gestures.
The camera quality is a bit underwhelming but I’m not using my laptop to film anything regularly, so it doesn’t bother me too much.
Other than that, this laptop is perfect for college students or people looking for something lightweight and stylish like a MacBook, affordable, and also dependable.
I love this laptop and can see myself sticking with the zen book for a long time.
