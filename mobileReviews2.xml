                The only complaint I have is the confusion with how many devices there are from Huawei for different markets.

                First a Nexus 6P (more for Google, but because Huawei built this phone I was more comfortable trying a pure Huawei phone afterwards) then an Honor 7X.

                This is where I had some trouble, because I purchased the international version, which was not made clear as to what networks it supports in the U.S, and many different websites have conflicting information based on whether you pull up the 3GB RAM model VS the 4GB RAM model.

                It's difficult to have confidence in your purchase when buying elsewhere, but buying the Mate SE from Amazon definitely gave me security and confidence in the choice I was making.

                I haven't had a single hick-up or issue with anything so far, if it weren't for the network issue I would have never gotten rid of the 4GB RAM 7X, the Mate SE makes you very happy that Huawei is working with American distributors because this is a very underrated device.

                Camera is ultra-responsive, finger-print is incredibly accurate and unlocks quicker than half-a second, which is hard to comprehend for the price and something I noticed was also equally responsive on the 7X.

                In all honesty, I feel like if OnePlus weren't trying to compete on upper-tier financial markets they would be cranking out phones like this no problem, but they're missing a chance to compete with yet another market that is making unparalleled devices for an unbelievable cost.
