I received this tablet last week and after several hours of use I can say that it is really a big upgrade to my aging (but still fully functional Samsung Galaxy Tab S). The screen is really beautiful, very vivid and HDR videos in Youtube are like when I saw a full HD for the first time. I am kind of an artist son the S pen is for me like a blessing. The only cons compared to my old Tab S is the screen aspect ratio, but I am slowly getting accustomed to it and it does not bother me as in the beginning I made a throughout research to buy a new tablet, and after this was released I decided to go for it, yes it es expensive, but after using it I have no remorse and this beautiful this is staying with me.
